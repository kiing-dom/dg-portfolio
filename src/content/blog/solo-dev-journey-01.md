> This blog will be structured differently than usual. The topic I am discussing isn't inherently techinal either. I just want to outline something that may well become a series of blog posts detailing my journey as a solo devloper. It might not be structured as it's just going to be me laying out my thoughts as best I can.

## why?
Well, it started off as a random thought. Like you see a lot of posts on social of media of $X$ person making $Y$ amount and you start to feel suspicious about whether it's actually possible. But recently I've seen enough to start believing that it is. Also with how easily accessible information is, I don't think there's a better time to start than right now.

## goals.
The goals are pretty simple. To build profitable products from zero while documenting the process through this blog series and also on social media platforms like [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@267dngi) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@_dngi).

Basically just giving regular updates on new products, features in existing products, and changes in userbase, and other key metrics to see if I can make the solo dev lifestyle a success.

As of now the only the only product I have hosted is '[brandalyze](https://brandalyze.io)' which as of now, is in it's MVP stage. So for now, the updates will focus on brandalyze's success.

So I'll close of this first blog by saying I'm looking forward to the grind and seeing results. Also join the waitlist and try brandalyze.
