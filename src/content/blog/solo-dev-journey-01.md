> This blog will be structured differently than usual. The topic I am discussing isn't inherently techinal either. I just want to outline something that may well become a series of blog posts detailing my journey as a solo devloper.

## why?
For a long time I've been led to believe that I should chase a 9-5 because of the safety and security. But unfortunately (I dont see it as unfortunate now) I had some roadblocks in finding employment after college and it opened my eyes to a lot. For the most part, those employed by corporate are just filling quotas. This is not to take away from the talent of engineers, but any competent applicant can be trained into a role player. This obviously doesn't include the rare engineers that are more capable than average. This means that most engineers are seen as replaceable by their companies, which has been shown worldwide with recent layoffs, hiring freezes, and a lot of treatment people face in gruelling interview processes.

I'm not saying that a 9-5s are not worth it, because they definitely are. My point is that if I had the option to work a stable job or work a stable job while grinding for my own freedom, the latter sounds much more gratifying personally.

## goals.
